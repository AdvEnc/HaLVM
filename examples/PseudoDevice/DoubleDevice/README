1. Description
--------------

IMPORTANT: You must run the 'make_halvm_dir.py' script before running this
example!

The DoubleDevice example sketches how one can write device drivers using the
Xen-standard ring buffer interface and HALVM. The device driver is fairly 
simple; it simply doubles numbers passed to it. The most interesting part
of this example is probably the file DoubleCommon.hs, which shows how one
creates a device-specific ring buffer. You may also want to look at the
call to 'brbAttach' in DoubleDevice.hs.

2. Building and Running
-----------------------

Use the following two commands:

If you haven't already, make the /halvm Xenstore directory:

  python ${HALVM_DIR}/bin/make_halvm_dir.py

You can then build and run the test by first running each of the
following in a separate window:

  make rundevice
  make runtest

To detach from the consoles in each window, type control-].  You may
then want to destroy the domains:

  make stop
