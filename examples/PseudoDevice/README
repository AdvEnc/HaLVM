======================================================

These examples show how the HaLVM can be used to create "pseudo-devices",
or potentially even real device back-ends, all using the standard Xen
ring buffer protocol for devices. The example applications are:

  - DoubleDevice: Defines a simple device in which a client domain sends
    the pseudo-device a number, and the 'device' returns the number
    doubled.

  - ROT13Device: A slightly more complicated example, in which clients 
    send the device a page of memory (via a grant reference), and the
    device ROT13 encodes the data on the page.
