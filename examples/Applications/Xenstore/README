1. Description
--------------

This example simply performs reads from the Xenstore, and is something akin
to an interactive version of the stock xenstore-ls command. 

2. Building and Running
-----------------------

 make run

or 

 make runC

for a more compact printout.

There is only a limited number of things a domU can read from the
Xenstore.  The following keys should be available: console, cpu,
memory, store.  Also, /halvm might be interesting to examine if you
have run any of the examples that populate that directory.
