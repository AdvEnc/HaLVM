======================================================

This directory contains examples that can be considered "whole program"
examples. That is, they contain self-contained functionality towards some
purpose, as opposed to some primary functionality with a few testing
routines.

These examples include:

  - ChatDemo: This example shows how one can build a multi-user chat server
    (with clients) using HaLVM instances.

  - DomainBuilder: This example shows how one domain can be used to build
    other domains using the supplied HaLVM libraries.

  - Filter: This example shows how one can set up a set of domains to
    perform some combined activity. In this case, it sets up three domains,
    A, B, and C, in which A takes in input and sends it to B, B filters the
    data and sends it to C, and C prints it out.

  - Xenstore: This example application constructs an interactive console
    in which users can query the values of Xenstore keys.
