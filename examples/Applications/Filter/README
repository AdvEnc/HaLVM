IMPORTANT: You must run the 'make_halvm_dir.py' script before running this
example!

This example shows how a domain can be interposed between other
domains to perform some useful task. In this example, PlayerA is
attempting to pass on some information to PlayerC. However, 
interposed between PlayerA and PlayerC is PlayerB, which is
responsible for making sure PlayerA does not leak classified 
information to PlayerC.

2. Building and Running
-----------------------

If you haven't already, make the /halvm Xenstore directory:

  sudo python ${HALVM_DIR}/bin/make_halvm_dir.py

Then start each in a separate window:

  make runA
  make runB
  make runC
