1. Description
--------------

IMPORTANT: You must run the 'make_halvm_dir.py' script before running this
example!

This example is our internal IVC speed test. Basically, one domain (Start)
starts up, sets up a channel rendezvous, and (once the channel has been 
established) just spews data down the channel as fast as it can. The other
domain (End) reads in the data in variously-sized chunks and reports on 
the transfer speed.

2. Building and Running
-----------------------

If you haven't already, make the /halvm Xenstore directory:

  python ${HALVM_DIR}/bin/make_halvm_dir.py

Build and start both Start and End by:

  make run

Varints with more VMs involved are:

  make run3

and

  make run6

To destroy the virtual machines, press Ctrl-], and then

  make stop
