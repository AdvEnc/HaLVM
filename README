1. System Requirements
----------------------

Every effort has been made to minimize the system dependencies of the HALVM.
We currently believe that the standard developer tools (make, autoconf, find,
sed, gcc, etc.), along with wget and an internet connection, should mostly
suffice to build the HALVM. The only additional requirement is an installation
of readline version 4. On Fedora Core 5, you can add this dependency using
'yum install compat-readline43'.

If you find any hidden dependencies that we are not aware of, please send
email to <awick@galois.com>

2. Building The HALVM
---------------------

You should be able to build the HALVM in the standard way: 

autoconf
./configure
make

A couple things to note:

  * The build process for the HALVM downloads six files from the internet.
    Thus, in order to run make for the first time, you will need a live
    internet connection.

  * The files downloaded will not be removed when you perform a "make clean".
    If you're updating to a new version and want to build completely from
    scratch, you may want to "make mrproper", which will remove them.

  * THE OUTPUT OF THE BUILD PROCESS IS A BINARY DISTRIBUTABLE. There is no
    make install target. You can find the binary distributable in the new
    'dist' directory.

3. Where To Look Next
---------------------

Once you've built a binary distribution, there should be copious documentation
in the 'dist' directory. To start, look at the README in that directory. You
may also wish to pursue the HTML documentation in dist/doc. Library references
for the GHC (dist/doc/ghc) and HALVM (dist/doc/libs) libraries can also be
found there.

4. A Guide To The Directories
-----------------------------

The directories you see in the source archive are as follows:

  BitFiddler/
    The HALVM BitFiddler library (byte order and bit structures)
  HALVMCore/
    The HALVMCore library (lots of good stuff)
  QuickCheck/
    A port of QuickCheck to the HALVM (automated testing)
  RendezvousLib/
    The HALVM RendezvousLib library (for creating IVC connections)
  XenDevice/
    The HALVM XenDevice library (device drivers)
  dist/ [generated]
    The final result of the build process; a binary distributable
  ghc-xen/ [generated]
    The port of GHC to Xen; a combination of ghc66-source-pull.tar.bz2, the
    GHC patches, and the additional C support.
  ghc-xen-sparse/
    Supplemental files used to greate GHC/Xen. This includes the layer atop
    Xen and the implementation of the necessary libc functions.
  halfs/
    A port of the Halfs file system to the HALVM (file system support)
  patches/
    Patches required to stock GHC to make GHC/Xen.
  platform_ghc/ [generated]
    A local installation of GHC 6.8.3, Haddock, Happy, and Alex, used to
    build the source in ghc-xen.
  static-bits/
    The static files included in the HALVM distribution (the README,
    CHANGELOG, etc.)
  xenghc/ [generated]
    An internal directory used as an intermediary stage between the build
    in ghc-xen and the distributable.
