<div class="answer_body">

<p>Operating systems and system service constructions is both tedious and
error prone. The goal of the HALVM is to give programmers the ability to
quickly and easily prototype system components, without having to spend
months in details they don't care about. For example, you could write a
device driver for Xen and concentrate on the device driver itself, while
letting a HALVM library cover the details of communicating with other
domains. For higher-level components, such as network servers, you can 
concentrate on the networking code without worrying about page tables and
other such details.</p>

<p>In this way, the HALVM is similar to the 
<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/">OSKit project</a>, with some
difference in target and execution. While the OSKit targeted C kernels 
written for bare hardware, the HALVM targets Haskell system software written
on top of Xen. It is our hope that using Haskell leads to increased productivity
and increased reliability in system components.</p>

<p>The HALVM is designed as a light-weight core with additional, optional
library services surrounding it. The core is a port of GHC 6.6 to Xen, and
incorporates code from NetBSD and Xen's MiniOS to cover some necessary C
libraries. There is also some custom code for mapping the underlying memory
management and event systems to their GHC equivalents. Around this core is
a thin layer of Haskell, re-exporting much of this functionality to HALVM
components. This "library" is called "HALVMCore", and its API is automatically
exported to Haskell programs.</p>

<p>Programmers may optionally include other libraries as they need to. Each
library is described in detail below, and documented in the 
<a href="libs/index.html">library documentation</a>.</p>

</div>


<a name="install"><h3>Installation</h3></a>

<div class="answer_body">

<p>The HALVM is distributed as a complete, in-place installation. To use,
simply include <tt>halvm/bin</tt> in your <tt>PATH</tt> environment 
variable or invoke the programs found there directly. No further setup 
is required. You may obviously move the entire directory structure around
as needed, but please be careful in splitting up the directories internally.
Many of the binaries assume that their associated <tt>lib</tt> directories
are at <tt>../lib</tt>.</p>

<p>Unlike previous HALVM releases, this release should not require any
particular version of GHC or GCC.</p>
</div>

<a name="dir"><h3>Directory Layout</h3></a>

<a name="halvmc"><h3>Using The HALVM and <tt>halvmc</tt></h3></a>

<div class="answer_body">

<h4>Writing HALVM Programs</h4>

<p>Programmers should write HALVM domains exactly as they would any
other program, with two exceptions. First, not all of the standard
GHC libraries are available to Haskell programmers. For example, the
implementation of GHC within the HALVM does not contain any of the
primitive libraries for performing I/O, including console, file and
network I/O. Instead, HALVM programmers should use one of the libraries,
below, for such functionality.</p>

<p>Second, HALVM domains should use either the <tt>halvm_kernel</tt>
or the <tt>halvm_kernel_daemon</tt> wrappers around their <tt>main</tt>
function. While not, strictly speaking, necessary, these routines 
perform a known, safe initialization and shutdown of the HALVM, including
guaranteed-correct device driver initialization and shutdown. Using 
these routines is fairly simple. First, rename what would have otherwise
been your <tt>main</tt> function to something else; <tt>start</tt>, for
example. Then, if your application uses the console and a disk, you 
can perform a safe start-up by adding the following to your main file:</p>

<center>
<code>
main = halvm_kernel [dConsole, dDisk] start
</code>
</center>

<h4>Using <tt>halvmc</tt></h4>

<p>While the HALVM distribution does include a port of GHC, using the
port directly requires the correct application of a large number of 
flags. To ease the process of building HALVM programs, the HALVM 
distribution includes the <tt>halvmc</tt> build script. Using this
script to build HALVM kernels is straightforward:</p>

<center>
<code>
halvmc -package XenDevice &lt;file&gt; ...
</code>
</center>

<p>To compile programs that use the XenDevice library, or</p>

<center>
<code>
halvmc &lt;file&gt; ...
</code>
</center>

<p>for programs that do not.</p>

<p>The script uses the GHC <tt>--make</tt> flag, so it will find any
libraries referenced by the file(s) given, as well as only recompile
files when they or their dependencies have changed. You can use other
options to determine where the compiler will look for and create object
and interface files.</p>

<p>Finally, <tt>halvmc</tt> can also be used to create Xen domain
configuration files while it builds kernels. The invocation of:

<center>
<code>
halvmc MyKernel.hs --with-config
</code>
</center>

<p>will not only generate a kernel file, <tt>MyKernel</tt>, but will
also create a domain config file, <tt>MyKernel_config</tt>. This kernel
file can then be used to create domains using 
<tt>xm create MyKernel_config</tt>. <tt>Halvmc</tt> also accepts command
line flags for adding disks, network cards, memory requirements, and so
forth to the config file.</p>

<p>For further information on <tt>halvmc</tt>, run the following:</p>

<center>
<code>
halvmc --help
</code>
</center>

</div>

<a name="libraries"><h3>An Overview Of The Libraries</h3></a>

<div class="answer_body">

<p>In order to make the HALVM a useful mechanism for prototyping
OS components, this distribution contains a set of libraries on
top of the base Haskell runtime. It is important to note that, 
with the exception of HALVMCore, compiling in these libraries is
optional. Thus, a network switch component that does not require
a file system does not need to bear the code complexity and size
burden of the file system library.</p>

<a name="halvmcore"><h4>HALVMCore</h4></a>

<p>The HALVMCore library exports a thin wrapper layer over the Xen 
hypercalls and the underlying runtime. These include routines for
managing memory, managing event channels, writing to the Xen 
emergency console, and a lighweight inter-VM communication system.
See the library reference on how to use these components.</p>

<p>This library also exports the <tt>halvm_kernel</tt> primitives
for cleanly starting and stopping system services, which HALVM
components are strongly suggested to use.</p>

<p>The HALVMCore layer is exposed automatically; you don't need to use
a <tt>-package</tt> flag in order to use the interfaces.</p>

<a name="xendevice"><h4>XenDevice</h4></a>

<p>The XenDevice library exports the standard set of Xen devices (the console,
Xenstore, disks and network cards) to HALVM domains. For complete details, 
see the library reference.</p>

<p>To use a device, a HALVM domain must pass the descriptor for that
device to either <tt>halvm_kernel</tt> or <tt>halvm_kernel_daemon</tt>.
These causes the appropriate initializers and shut down routines to be
called as the system starts up, shuts down, or fails. Currently, the
XenDevice library includes four device descriptors: <tt>dConsole</tt>,
<tt>dXenbus</tt>, <tt>dDisks</tt>, and <tt>dNICs</tt>.</p>

<p>The XenDevice layer is not automatically included in HALVM builds.
If you use it, you should pass <tt>-package XenDevice</tt> to either
<tt>halvmc</tt> or <tt>halvm-ghc</tt>.

<a name="rendezvous"><h4>RendezvousLib</h4></a>

<p>The RendezvousLib is a package that contains modules for setting up
type-safe IVC communication between domains.  Currently the package
depends on dXenbus, which means the domains must have an existing
communication channel to a XenStore, which will be used for
rendezvous.  The module RendezvousLib.PeerToPeer supports point-to-point
communication between two domains, through the use of a key that is
unique in the XenStore.  RendezvousLib.ClientServer
supports Client-server communication patterns to be established
between a server domain and any number of client domains.  Again, the
domains have to a agree on a unique key.</p>

<p>Several of the <a href="#examples">example programs</a> demonstrate
how to use these communication patterns.</p>

<a name="halfs"><h4>Halfs</h4></a>

<p>This distribution contains a port of the 
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/halfs/">Halfs</a> filesystem to the
HALVM. The modifications to standard Halfs should be largely invisible
to users. The primary difference is that when using the functions to
mount or initialize a file system, the name of the disk in question 
should be used rather than the path of the file system in dom0. For
example, if your config file maps <tt>/dev/vg00/myfs</tt> to <tt>hda1</tt>,
then to create a new file system, you should use <tt>newFS "hda1" 
size</tt>.</p>

<p>Finally, the HALVM port of Halfs does not modify the Halfs file
system layout in any way. Thus, users might want to install a stock
version of Halfs, so that they can mount, traverse, and populate 
the file system in domain 0.</p>

<p>The Halfs layer is not automatically included in HALVM builds.
If you use it, you should pass <tt>-package HALVMHalfs</tt> to either
<tt>halvmc</tt> or <tt>halvm-ghc</tt>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Xen only allows disk device names that look like 
standard Unix disk device names. So you can call a disk <tt>hda4</tt>,
but cannot call it <tt>halvm_fs</tt>. This is a restriction on Xen,
not the HALVM, and somewhat annoying.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b>When writing to a Halfs file system, it is <em>very
important</em> that you cleanly unmount the file system within the
correct monad before exiting. For example, when using the 
<tt>withFSWrite</tt> function, the last item in the computation 
should be <tt>unmountWriteFS</tt>. If you do not unmount the file 
system, or unmount it within the wrong monad, some buffered 
modifications may be lost.</p>

<a name="examples"><h3>An Overview Of The Examples</h3></a>

<div class="answer_body">

<p>This HALVM distribution contains several example programs intended
to show how different parts of the system can be used. This section is
intended as a general overview, so that you can find examples that 
contain functionality that interests you. All of the examples can be
found in the <a href="../examples/"><tt>examples</tt></a> directory of the distribution.</p>

<a name="ex:ivc">
  <h4><u>Inter-Domain Communication</u>: Filter, ChatDemo, and
    SpeedTest</h4>
</a>

<p>These examples display how HALVM programmers can create a set of
communicating domains. All of these examples use RendezvousLib to hide
the details of how domain can find each other through the XenStore and
the HALVMCore IVC library for communication.</p>

<p>The <tt>SpeedTest</tt> example shows two domains communicating, and
determines the bandwidth between two communicating domains. For those
curious, it also shows off some of the HALVM clock support.</p>

<p>The <tt>Filter</tt> example shows how a set of domains can be set 
up in serial. In this example, one domain takes in input and sends it
to a second domain. This second domain filters some words out of the
data stream before passing it on to a third domain, which prints out
the filtered input.</p>

<p>Finally, the <tt>ChatDemo</tt> example shows how a client/server 
model can be set up using HALVMs and RendezvousLib. One domain, the
chat server, listens for connections from an arbitrary number of child
domains. The whole system functions something like an IRC chatroom.</p>

<a name="ex:transfer">
  <h4><u>Transferring Information</u>: TransferTest and CopyTest</h4>
</i>

<p>The <tt>TransferTest</tt> and <tt>CopyTest</tt> examples are very 
brief examples of alternative ways of transferring information between
domains. The <tt>TransferTest</tt> example shows how domains can use the
Xen concept of "Grant Transfers" to transfer a page of memory from one
domain to another. The <tt>CopyTest</tt> shows off "Grant Copies".</p>

<p>Note that grant copies were introduced in Xen 3.0.3, so HALVM 
distributions for earlier versions of Xen will not contain the necessary
API calls.</p>

<a name="ex:dev">
  <h4><u>Designing Device Drivers</u>: DoubleDevice and ROT13Device</h4>
</a>

<p>The <tt>DoubleDevice</tt> and <tt>ROT13Device</tt> examples show how
programmers can write device drivers on the HALVM, using the same generalized
ring buffer interface as existing devices. While both "device drivers" are
entirely written in software, it should be easy to see how one could hook
up hardware device driver code instead of software device driver code.</p>

<p>Both libraries use the RendezvousLib library's client / server system 
for clarity, and the RingBuffer library to support interact with device
driver clients. The <tt>DoubleDevice</tt> driver takes in numbers and 
doubles them. The <tt>ROT13Device</tt> library takes in string data and
ROT13 encodes it.</p>

<a name="ex:xen">
  <h4><u>Interacting With Xen</u>: XenStore</h4>
</a>

<p>The XenStore example simply shows how HALVM programs can interact with
the existing XenStore using the XenDevice library.</p>

<a name="ex:disk">
  <h4><u>Using The Disk</u>: VBDTest and BasicHalfs</h4>
</a>

<p>The <tt>VBDTest</tt> example shows how HALVM components can interact 
with a low-level disk device. The example simply writes out successively
smaller series of blocks to the disk, and then reads them back in to check
that they were written.</p>

<p>The <tt>BasicHalfs</tt> example is a not-very-well-written set of 
examples using the Halfs file system.</pp>

</div> <!-- Examples section -->

<a name="printf"><h3>The Most Important Two Things In This Document</h3></a>

<div class="answer_body">

<p>While Haskell offers many benefits to OS programmers, it is still 
possible to write buggy code. Thus, the two most important things you
should do when writing HALVM programs are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure that Xen was compiled with debug console support for
    user domains. See <a href="debugcon">Setting up the debug console</a>,
    below.</li>
  <li>Make use of the debug console.</li>
</ol>

<p>In contrast to the "normal" console, the debug console is only lightly
buffered. It also uses a hypercall interface rather than an IVC interface,
so is not subjected to IVC lag. Thus, the debug console is your best method
of determining what a program is executing.</p>

</div> <!-- debug console -->

<a name="xen"><h3>Useful Modifications To Xen</h3></a>
<div class="answer_body">

<p>As distributed, it is possible to write and run HALVM domains on 
stock versions of Xen. However, some functionality of a HALVM may be
impaired on some versions of Xen, and debugging programs in stock 
versions of Xen may be difficult. This section contains some patches
on the stock version of Xen that you may find convenient and/or 
necessary to write the programs you want to write.</p>

<a name="debugcon"><h4>Setting Up The Debug Console</h4></a>

<p>Probably the most helpful thing you can do with your Xen installation
is to enable the debug console. How you do this depends on your version
of Xen and how you have set up your development machine.</p>

<p><u>If you use a serial console</u> all that should be required is to
build and install Xen using the <tt>verbose=y</tt> flag. Thus, doing a basic
build and install of Xen requires <tt>make verbose=y world</tt> and
<tt>make verbose=y install</tt>. Note that it is necessary to pass this
flag for both the build and the install.</p>

<p><u>If you do not use a serial console</u>, you still must pass the
<tt>verbose=y</tt> flag to both the build and install commands, but you
must also modify Xen. <u>For Xen 3.0.2</u> change line 349 (or thereabouts) 
in <tt>$XENSOURCE/xen/drivers/char/console.c</tt> from 
<tt>putchar_console</tt> to <tt>putchar_console_ring</tt>. <u>For Xen
3.0.3+</u>, modify <tt>guest_console_write</tt> in 
<tt>$XENSOURCE/xen/drivers/char/console.c</tt>, adding 
<tt>printk("%s",kbuf);</tt> after the call to <tt>sercons_puts</tt> on
line 322.</p>

<p>These changes for non-serial console machines put debug console messages 
on the internal Xen log, which you can view using the command <tt>xm 
dmesg</tt>.</p>

<a name="xen303com">
  <h4>Xen 3.0.3+: Enabling Inter-VM Communication</h4>
</a>

<p>Versions of Xen after 3.0.3 (roughly) forbid user domains from 
communicating with each other. Obviously, this is a problem for many
example programs as well as many use cases for a lightweight virtual 
machine. Thus, it is probably a good idea to disable the access check
so that user domains can communicate with each other.</p>

<p>The relevant check is called <tt>grant_operation_permitted</tt> and
can be found in <tt>$XENBASE/xen/include/xen/iocap.h</tt>. Internally,
we just change the definition to 
<tt>#define grant_operation_permitted(d) 1</tt>, and have had not had
problems with it. Making this change requires a rebuild of Xen.</p>

<a name="privil">
  <h4>Enabling Privileged Commands</h4>
</a>

<p>Some HALVM components may require use of the privileged operations
in the Hypervisor.Privileged and Hypervisor.Memory modules. In these 
cases, it is necessary to modify Xen to allow user domains to execute
privileged commands. Please note that by making this change you are 
creating an enormous security hole in your system, and we do not recommend
this except on development boxes where the destruction or compromise of
the entire machine would not be a problem.</p>

<p>If you're OK with the huge, gaping, awful security hole, all that 
is required is to modify the <tt>IS_PRIV</tt> definition in 
<tt>$XENBASE/xen/include/sched.h</tt> to <tt>#define IS_PRIV(_d) 1</tt>.
Again, making this change requires a rebuild of Xen.</p>
