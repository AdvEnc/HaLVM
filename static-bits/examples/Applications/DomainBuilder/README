This directory uses the HALVM domain-builder library in some examples
demonstrating its capabilities.  The domain builder will get the child
images from Xen as modules.

Dependencies:

  For mini-os and linux examples:
    Built mini-os and TRP-kernels in a XEN source tree (XEN_BIN_ROOT/../..).

How to build examples and what they demonstrate:

  make testIvc.run

    This will build two HALVM domains and establishes a static IVC
    between them.  The child domains will send a message along the
    channel.

  make testminios.run

    This builds the mini-os domain from the Xen distribution.
    
  make testlinux.run

    This builds the xenTRP kernel and launches it with an initramfs
    containing a "Hello World" init program.  The init program is
    found in init.c.

  make testConsole.run

    Creates a domain builder that builds a child and gives it a
    console connection.  The parent writes a string to the child, 
    which bounces the string back again to the parent.

There is also an automated test for the examples, exercised by "make test".
