IMPORTANT: You must run the 'make_halvm_dir.py' script before running this
example!

This is an example of using multiple grant references to share a contiguous
block of >4K using grant references. The critical call is mapGrants.

2. Building and Running
-----------------------

If you haven't already, make the /halvm Xenstore directory:

  python ${HALVM_DIR}/bin/make_halvm_dir.py

Build and run the test with:

  make run
