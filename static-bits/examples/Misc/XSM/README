This boots a domain confined by an XSM (Xen Security Modules) policy,
reading and writing from the hypervisor console.  It runs in
permissive mode, and there is one access violation reported:

(XEN) avc:  denied  { stat } for domid=0
(XEN) scontext=system_u:system_r:dom0_t tcontext=system_u:system_r:dom0_t
(XEN) tclass=mmu

It requires a policy being compiled, which can be done by typing "make"
in in $(XEN_BIN_ROOT)/../../tools/flask/policy.

It also requires Xen to be built with 

  XSM_ENABLE ?= y
  FLASK_ENABLE ?= y

in Config.mk.

The program can be exercised in qemu by typing "make test".
