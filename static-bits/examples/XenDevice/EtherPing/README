1. Description
--------------

This example implements a simple Ethernet ping/pong service on a HALVM.
In this example, one HALVM (Server), sits and waits for ping requests. 
When it gets one, it sends back a pong response to the sender.

The other HALVM(s) (Pinger), send a ping message once per second, and
report on any pong responses received. You should be able to run 
several of these concurrently, if you want to.

This example shows how to read and write to the bare network card, how
to manage MBufs, and how to use CompactStruct to handle packed structures.


2. Building and Running
-----------------------

As per the usual Makefile conventions. 'make Server' and 'make Pinger'
will build the programs. 'make runServer' and 'make runPinger' will run
the programs.
