1. Description
--------------

This is more of a test case than an example. At a high-level, it takes
every disk given to it and performs several write/read tests on each. 
These include synchronous writes and reads at different block sizes, as
will as a few tests of the asynchronous write/read system. It takes quite
awhile to run.

2. Building and Running
-----------------------

 halvmc -package XenDevice VBDTest.hs --with-config --disk ...

You should use at least one disk with this command. You then run it as per
normal:

 sudo xm create VBDTest_config -c

If you're using linux virtual disks, you can create a disk as follows:

  lvcreate -L 64M -n vbdtest vg00

Which creates a 64 meg volume called vbdtest on the volume vg00. Then
compile the example with

  halvmc -package XenDevice VBDTest.hs --with-config --disk "phy:/dev/vg00/vbdtest,hda1,w"
