1. Description
--------------

This directory includes the ARPSniffer example. As you'd expect from the name, 
ARPSniffer implements a virtual machine that simply observes ARP requests and
responses coming over the network. It is a good example of how to do basic 
networking on the bare network card, of how to use the CompactStruct interface
for deconstructing bit-packed structures, and of how to manage MBufs.

Please note that this is, technically, a packet sniffer. You should make sure
that your system administrator and local laws allow you to run this program
before running it.


2. Building and Running
-----------------------

You should be able to just run 'make' to compile the program, and 'make run'
to run it.
