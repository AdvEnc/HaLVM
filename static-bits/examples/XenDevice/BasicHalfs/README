1. Description
--------------

This directory contains two examples / test cases making use of the
Halfs port to the HALVM. They are probably not great examples of
good Haskell programming practice, but are included in order to give
a taste of how file system interaction can function within a HALVM.

The first example, FSWrite.hs, creates a new file system on "hda1"
and populates it with two files and a directory. 

The second example, FSRead.hs, performs a deep find on "hda1" and
then prints out the two files created with FSWrite.

NOTE: I'd strongly suggest using a small disk (64M) for this test
case, so that initialization doesn't run you out of memory.
