======================================================

These examples show how HaLVM programs can interact with Xen-virtualized
devices.

  - ARPSniffer: Uses the network card driver for Xen to implement a domain
    that listens for ARP traffic and prints out information about it.

  - EtherPing: Creates two domains, where one pings the other via the
    network card interface.

  - VBDTest: A simple block read/write tester for using Xen disk devices.

  - Halfs: Two simple (but not well-written) examples of using the Halfs
    file system on top of Xen disk devices.
