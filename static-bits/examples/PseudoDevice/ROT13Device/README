1. Description
--------------

IMPORTANT: You must run the 'make_halvm_dir.py' script before running this
example!

This example is in the same vein of the DoubleDevice, with two changes:

  (1) This example does very little error checking, as it is intended
      to be used as an on-the-fly implementation demo.

  (2) It uses a slightly more complicated response function.

2. Building and Running
-----------------------

Use the following two commands:

If you haven't already, make the /halvm Xenstore directory:

  python ${HALVM_DIR}/bin/make_halvm_dir.py

You can then build the device as follows (in two terminals):

  make runBackend
  make runTest

Type some text to the frontend and finish with a period on its own line.

If you are not building this in the $HALVM/examples/ROT13Device directory,
you should include the --ghc-includes $HALVM/examples/ROT13Device command
line flag.
