======================================================

These examples show how the basic IVC mechanisms can be used in writing
HaLVM domains.

  - SpeedTest: Uses the IVC mechanism described in Hypervisor.IVC, and then
    performs tests to see what transfer speeds are reached along those 
    channels.

  - CopyTest: Shows how one can use the Xen concept of a "grant copy" between
    two domains.

  - TransferTest: Shows how one can use the Xen concept of a "grant 
    transfer" (page flipping) between two domains.
