======================================================

These libraries show how libIVC can be used to talk to HaLVM domains 
from a Linux domain. 

  - ROT13Echo: A HaLVM sends text data to a Linux domain, which 
    ROT13 encodes the data and sends it back, using two-way 
    IVC channels.

  - SysLog: A HaLVM creates a one way channel to a Linux domain, 
    and uses the Linux domain as a log point.

  - CryptoDevice: Creates a C crypto "device backend", and a HaLVM
    that uses it. The device encrypts and decrypts pages using AES
    using the OpenSSl library.

  - CryptoDevice2: Just as CryptoDevice, but it uses two-way channels
    and the Data.Binary interface for communication, rather than Xen
    device ring bufffers.
