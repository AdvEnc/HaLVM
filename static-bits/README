1. Background and Overview
--------------------------

Operating system and system service construction is both tedious and error 
prone. The goal of the HALVM is to give to programmers the ability to quickly
and easily prototype system components, without having to spend months lost
in the details. For example, you could write a device driver for Xen and
concentrate on the device driver itself, while letting a HALVM library cover
the details of communicating with other domains. Or, for higher-level 
components such as network servers, you can concentrate on the network server
without worrying about page tables and other such details.

The HALVM is designed as a minimal core with library support built around
that core. Minimal HALVM builds that use no libraries are very lightweight;
the minimal HALVM program ("main = return ()") generates a 490K ELF binary
as of the time of writing. The attempt is to have programmers pay for code
size when they need the code involved. Suggestions on how to improve the
HALVM to do better in this regard are always appreciated.

Fundamentaly, the HALVM is a port of the GHC runtime to the Xen guest-OS
interface, with no intervening OS. The runtime contains no direct support
for file systems, networking, or devices, but does support the standard
Haskell execution model, including concurrency and exceptions. Currently,
however, the HALVM does not support multiple processors, nor does it 
support 64-bit execution mode.

A more in depth description of the HALVM's design is available with the
rest of the HALVM documentation in the doc/ directory of this distribution.
Please see doc/index.html for an overview.

2. Installation
---------------

The HALVM is distributed as an in-place tarball. To install it, simply
unpack it (as you've already done!), put it where you want it, and include
the bin/ subdirectory in your path. No further work need be done.

Unlike previous releases of the HALVM, the HALVM is not dependent upon
any particular version of GHC or GCC ... so far as we've tested.

3. Quick Start
--------------

1) Add /home/username/halvm/bin to PATH
     export PATH=$PATH:~/halvm/bin
   or
     setenv PATH $PATH:~/halvm/bin

2) cd to the Xenstore example directory
     cd ~/halvm/examples/Xenstore

4) Compile the Xenstore example
     make Xenstore

5) Start the domain
     sudo xm create Xenstore_config -c

6) When it prompts you for things to list, try:
     console
     memory
     store

To quit back to the shell, hit CTRL-].

4. Where To Look Next
---------------------

Extensive documentation for the HALVM base system, the 'halvmc' convenience
script, and the included libraries is in the doc/ directory.

Please see doc/index.html for more information.
